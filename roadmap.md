# Realstretch Roadmap

## Todo
- Post demo video
- Create site for Realstretch explaining design/features
- Post warning/recommendations for Window size
- Post instructions for using the effect
- Reframe Release as milliseconds instead of the coefficient value.
- Include both mono and stereo versions in next release.
- Post instructions for opening app from web on MacOS.
- Randomization amount control
  - I think this works: `(random_blend)*(random_phase_value) + (1-random_blend)*(original_phase_value)`
