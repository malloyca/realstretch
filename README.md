# realstretch
Realtime implementation of the Paulstretch audio time-stretch algorithm using a novel buffer management technique

### Prerequisites

The Matlab software and audio toolbox are required to edit and compile the project.
They are available from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
* VST and AudioUnit (both MacOS) are available in the Plugins folder.
A Windows version of the VST will be added soon.

### Paulstretch
