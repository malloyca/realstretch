# realstretch
Realtime implementation of the Paulstretch audio time-stretch algorithm using a novel buffer management technique

### Prerequisites
* This project is coded in Matlab using the audio toolbox.
The Matlab software and audio toolbox are required to edit and compile the project.
They are available from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
* VST and AudioUnit compiled versions of the plugin will be uploaded soon.
They should be work with any major digital audio workstation (DAW) that can host VST or AU plugins.


### Paulstretch
This project is based on the Paulstretch algorithm.
If you are interested in that project there are GitHub pages for:
* The original [C++](https://github.com/paulnasca/paulstretch_cpp) version and...
* The [Python](https://github.com/paulnasca/paulstretch_python) version.
