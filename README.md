# realstretch
Realtime implementation of the Paulstretch audio time-stretch algorithm using a novel buffer management technique

### Prerequisites
* This project is coded in Matlab using the audio toolbox.
The Matlab software and audio toolbox are required to edit and compile the project.
They are available from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

### Installation
* Pre-compiled VST and AU versions of the plugin for MacOS are available under bundled in the latest release.
To download them, click on 'Latest Release' on the left side of the page.
They will be listed under 'Assets'.
