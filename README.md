# realstretch
Realtime implementation of the Paulstretch audio time-stretch algorithm using a novel buffer management technique

### Prerequisites

The Matlab software and audio toolbox are required to edit and compile the project.
They are available from [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).

### Plugin installation
Pre-compiled versions of the plugin are available here:
* MacOS:
  * [AudioUnit](https://github.com/malloyca/realstretch/files/4848239/macos-realstretch.component.zip) (stereo only)
  * [VST](https://github.com/malloyca/realstretch/files/4848240/macos-realstretch.vst.zip) (stereo only)
* Windows:
  * Coming soon.

Mono versions of the plugins are also coming soon.
